# LangGraph RAG (Modularized) + Flask UI (Updated)

This repo modularizes your LangGraph RAG agent and exposes a minimal ChatGPT-like UI (text input + upload PDF).
The front-end has been updated with drag-and-drop upload, rounded buttons, glossy beige gradient styling,
inline upload progress, and other UI improvements.

Setup:
1. Create a Python virtualenv and activate it.
2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set GOOGLE_API_KEY in your environment if using Google GenAI.
4. Run: python app.py
